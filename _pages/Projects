## ‚úÖ **Objective**

In this project, I set out to:
- Explain what web scraping is and why it's useful.
- Choose a website to scrape and justify the choice.
- Use Python to extract, clean, and save data for future analysis.

## üßê **What is Web Scraping?**

Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites.  
It uses tools or scripts to:
- Navigate webpages
- Parse HTML content
- Collect and structure data like text, tables, images

It‚Äôs commonly applied in:
- Price monitoring
- Data mining & analytics
- Research and archiving
- Automating manual data collection tasks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Always respect websites‚Äô terms of service and robots.txt.

## üîó **Target Website**

I used:
> [scrapethissite.com](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/?page_num=16)

Why?
- It‚Äôs designed for practice (ethical scraping)
- Contains tabular data, great for parsing with Python
- Publicly accessible and simple HTML structure

## üêç **Tools & Libraries**

| Tool | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `requests` | Download webpage HTML |
| `BeautifulSoup` | Parse and extract data from HTML |
| `pandas` | Organize data into DataFrames |
| `pickle` | Save the final model/pipeline (if needed) |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Steps**

1. **Fetch webpage**:  
   Use `requests.get()` to retrieve HTML content.

2. **Parse HTML**:  
   Initialize BeautifulSoup:  
   ```python
   soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser')
