## ⚡ Hi, I’m Denis Ndemwa

I’m an **Electrical and Electronics Engineer** with a passion for building smarter systems — where **hardware design meets data-driven intelligence**.

I explore and create at the crossroads of:
- 🛠 Embedded systems & IoT
- 📊 Data science & visualization
- 🤖 Machine learning & AI applications

From **prototyping innovative devices** to **extracting insights from complex datasets**, I believe the next wave of solutions comes from blending **circuits, code, and data**.

> *“Engineering isn’t just about hardware — it’s about making systems that learn, adapt, and make a difference.”*

In this space, you’ll find:
- My **projects** — from circuit boards to predictive models
- **Research notes** on AI & embedded systems
- Articles & ideas on how **data meets devices**
